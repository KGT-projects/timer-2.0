This here is a tmer i built a while ago.

i made it for a scouting camp, but its still a cool project!
i sent alot more time on this then i wanted, because of alot of stuff whould'nt work.

currently it is working, but only via github.
you could take my code and post it in a github reposetory, add a branch and make a github key.
then use it yourself, i made it so the timer has 36 hours, and you could take off 4 hours off the timer at any time you want.
also i made a reset button, so you could reset the timer if necesary.

if you want to use my code, please go ahead, but make sure u follow the steps i told.
if you want too edit, how much time in total there is, u need too update the time file.
and if you want to edit how much times the button takes away you need too update the control file, lines : 24 and 67.

make sure u change the numbers, so if you want 1 hour every time you click the button, make it like this:

line 24:  \\\\\<button onclick="subtract()">-1 Hour</button>
line 67:
